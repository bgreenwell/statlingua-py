Your response MUST be a valid JSON object that can be parsed directly into an R list.
The JSON object should have the following top-level keys, each containing a string with the relevant part of the explanation (formatted as plain text or simple Markdown within the string if appropriate for that section):
- "title": A concise title for the explanation.
- "model_overview": A general description of the model type and its purpose in this context.
- "coefficient_interpretation": Detailed interpretation of model coefficients/parameters.
- "significance_assessment": Discussion of p-values, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.
- "goodness_of_fit": Evaluation of model fit (e.g., R-squared, AIC, deviance).
- "assumptions_check": Comments on important model assumptions and how they might be checked.
- "key_findings": A bulleted list (as a single string with newlines `\n` for bullets) of the main conclusions.
- "warnings_limitations": Any warnings, limitations, or caveats regarding the model or its interpretation.

Example of expected JSON structure:
{
  "title": "Explanation of Linear Regression Model for Car Sales",
  "model_overview": "This is a linear regression model...",
  "coefficient_interpretation": "The coefficient for 'Price' is -0.10, suggesting that...",
  "significance_assessment": "The p-value for 'Price' is very small (< 0.001)...",
  "goodness_of_fit": "The R-squared value is 0.87, indicating...",
  "assumptions_check": "Assumptions such as linearity and homoscedasticity should be checked by examining residual plots.",
  "key_findings": "- Price is a significant negative predictor of sales.\n- Advertising has a positive impact on sales.",
  "warnings_limitations": "This model is based on simulated data and results should be interpreted with caution."
}

Ensure the entire output is ONLY the JSON object.
DO NOT wrap your entire response in JSON code fences (e.g., ```json ... ``` or ``` ... ```).
DO NOT include any conversational pleasantries or introductory/concluding phrases.
