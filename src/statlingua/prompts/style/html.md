Your response should be a valid HTML fragment suitable for direct embedding into an HTML document.
- Use appropriate HTML tags for structure (e.g., `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`).
- Use `<strong>` for bold and `<em>` for italics.
- Ensure all HTML is well-formed.
- Do not include `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags unless specifically instructed to provide a full document. Focus on providing the content block.
- For tables, generate complete and valid HTML table structures.

DO NOT wrap your entire response in Markdown code fences or any other non-HTML wrappers.
DO NOT include any conversational pleasantries or introductory/concluding phrases that are not part of the core HTML statistical explanation itself.
The output should be pure HTML.
