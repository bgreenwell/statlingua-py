Your response should be the statistical explanation directly, formatted as standard Markdown.
- Use headings (e.g., `## Section`, `### Subsection`) to structure the explanation.
- Use bullet points (`*` or `-`) for lists.
- Use bold (`**text**`) and italics (`*text*`) for emphasis where appropriate.
- Present tables using Markdown table syntax.
- Ensure mathematical notation is represented in a way that is easily convertible to MathJax/KaTeX if possible (e.g., using LaTeX-like syntax for inline math like `$E=mc^2$` and display math like `$$...$$`, though Markdown renderers vary in support).

DO NOT wrap your entire response in Markdown code fences (e.g., ```markdown ... ``` or ``` ... ```).
DO NOT include any conversational pleasantries or introductory/concluding phrases that are not part of the core statistical explanation itself, unless specifically part of the requested explanation format (e.g., a heading).
The output should be ready to be directly rendered as Markdown.
Your primary goal is to produce clean, well-structured Markdown.
