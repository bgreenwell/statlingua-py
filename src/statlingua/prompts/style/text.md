Your response should be the statistical explanation directly, formatted as plain text.
- Use blank lines to separate paragraphs and sections.
- Use simple markers like `*` or `-` for list items if necessary, but avoid complex formatting.
- Headings can be simple uppercase lines or followed by a line of hyphens.

DO NOT use any Markdown syntax (like `##`, `**`, `*` for emphasis).
DO NOT wrap your entire response in Markdown code fences.
DO NOT include any conversational pleasantries or introductory/concluding phrases that are not part of the core statistical explanation itself.
The output should be simple, readable plain text.
